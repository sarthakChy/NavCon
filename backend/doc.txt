Introduction¶
The Mappls Web Maps JavaScript SDK is a tool that enables the creation and customization of interactive maps for both India and the global context. Developed by Mappls (MapmyIndia) India's leading Map provider, this SDK is designed to produce mobile-friendly maps with a user-friendly interface and excellent performance. It consists of a set of classes and functions that allow developers to incorporate a wide range of map features into their web and mobile applications.

Web Map Features¶
Zoom: A map of India that can be panned or scrolled, allowing users to explore it in various levels of detail. The highest level of detail is achieved at a zoom level of 22, while the lowest level provides a global view at zoom level 1.
Overlays: We recognize the significance of maps in businesses, and that's why, at Mappls, we offer pre-made overlays that can be easily integrated into your code, streamlining the process and reducing the need for repetitive code.
Map Markers (Pushpins): You can pinpoint any location using the default map markers (pushpin) feature, and then you have the flexibility to customize its appearance to align with the unique style of your application. Check out the Plug-ins section for additional enhancements that can elevate your customization options.
Info Windows (Pop-ups): When a user clicks on a pushpin, an information window automatically appears, allowing user to display location-specific content. You have the flexibility to customize its appearance and behavior to perfectly match your UI and enhance its appeal.
Polylines: Connect any two points or even more with out of the box Mappls polylines dedicated to high customizability and performance to suit your use cases. Note: Have a look at the plug-ins we provide to make your polylines have an edge up and suit your use cases in a more integrated manner.
Polygons: Show a region in spotlight with a polygon and show various localized data based on it.
Circles: Circles are way of marking a territory without too much interaction by the user.You can draw a circle around a given location.
Controls: We understand the different use cases a user can come accross with a map, so we provide the flexibility of control that can be turned off or on based on your requirement and override our controls outlook by providing your own styles or CSS so that you can move them or customize them completely. Controls include:
Zoom Bar: (appears by default at the centre on the right side). Helps to provide zoom in and zoom out functionality to the map by default.
Map Layer Control: Allows to change the map view from basic to hybrid and regional. Also allows to show traffic layer on map.
Fullscreen Control: Allows to view a full screen map.
Current Location Control: Scopes the Map to the viewer’s current location.**
Note:The location settings must be turned on and must allow the site to fetch the location for this control to work.

Please Note: Mappls(MapmyIndia) may extend and enhance functionality for its interactive map API in future, which will be documented in this section, and which will be available through the Mappls.

Getting Access¶
Before using the API in the your solution, please ensure that the related access is enabled in the Mappls Console, within your app - be it for Mobile OR Web or Cloud integration.

Copy and paste the key from your credentials section from your API keys into the access_token query parameter.
Your static key can be secured by whitelisting its usage for particular IPs (in case of cloud app usage) OR a set of domains (in case of a web app)

Getting Started¶
Now that you’re all caught up with the features let’s get down right to them implementing and look at how can you integrate our interactive Map to your Website from scratch.

Understanding Map Methods, Events & Properties¶
Mappls Live Demo | CodePen Implementation

The easiest way to start loading maps in a web page is with a “Hello World” sample code, you can download or view a working “Hello World” sample from the links for adding your first marker below.

Adding the Map Script to your web page¶
Follow the below steps to integrate Mappls interactive Maps into your existing code base or even a File -> New Project. - Declare application as HTML5: Define <!DOCTYPE html> on top of your HTML. - Integrate Interactive maps from Mappls into your browser application by simply including Mappls's interactive map API in your script source in the head section.

      <script src="https://sdk.mappls.com/map/sdk/web?v=3.0&access_token=<Static Key>"></script>

            
            
        
**Important:**
- Please ensure that you insert your *static key* in place of `<Static Key>`
- *`v`*: This is the version. Please keep as the latest version: `3.0`.
- *`layer`*: The type of map applicable for the project. The default is `vector`. Alternate value is `raster`.

Please discuss with [apisupport@mappls.com](mailto:apisupport@mappls.com) for futher clarification and support.

            
            
        
Define style in the head section to load your CSS. CSS can be defined as per the developers requirement (Extenal, Internal and inline)
        <style> html, body, #map1 {margin: 0;padding: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} </style>

            
            
        
Define a div object in the body tag of the HTML where you want the Mappls Map to show up.
        <div id="map"></div>;

            
            
        
Initialize a Mappls Map by simply calling new Mappls.Map() in the JavaScript and passing it at the minimum, the div object in which you want the map populated. (All other parameters are optional.)
        map = new mappls.Map('map', {center:{lat:28.612964,lng:77.229463} });

Utilizing markers to pinpoint locations is a hassle-free approach. You have the option to use the markers we provide as the default choice, and if you wish to use your own custom markers, we've got that aspect covered as well.

Types of Markers¶
Stock Markers: The one you get out of the box using our Interactive Vector Maps SDK and you can select from a lot of choices.
Custom Marker: In case you want to add your own markers, we’ve handled that for you as well.
HTML Marker: In case you don’t want to add in an image you can use HTML to create a marker and then plot it on the map as well.
For more details, please read article in Markers

Marker Implementation¶

For details, please read article in KML Overlay

Info Windows¶
Mappls Live Demo | Code Pen Implementation

Info Windows provide a user-friendly method for displaying information related to a marker, essentially explaining the purpose of that marker. When users encounter a marker, their natural instinct is to click on it to discover more details, and presenting an info window is the ideal approach to fulfill this expectation.

Please Note: Our JS supports a default info window that you can leverage but we want you to have an option to customize your info window to fit in with your UI and you can do so by manipulating the CSS.

For a quick sample or a demo you can follow up with the links on live Demo

Polylines¶
Mappls Live Demo | Code Pen Implementation

Polylines are a means of visualizing movement or routes on a map, and at Mappls, we recognize the various ways you can make use of a map's capabilities, with Polylines being one of them.

Polylines are essentially uninterrupted lines formed by one or more line segments, preferably represented as a geopath. To include a polyline, follow the initial map setup as described in the earlier sections, and then establish a dataset. What exactly is a dataset? It's the assembly of points (latitude and longitude coordinates) that defines the path along which you wish the polyline to be depicted.

For details , please read article in Polylines

Remove Polyline Method in JS

    mappls.remove({map: map, layer: polyline);

            
            
        
In real case scenarios, you’ll need to get the data set on the fly or from a service and then you can leverage the events and functions we’ve learnt about how to plot the polyline. You also might need to beautify your polyline or add transitions for your UI to look marvelous.

The polyline is just the beginning, but sometimes you’ll need to mark a territory to properly showcase your information. In such cases a polyline might not be the perfect fit but Polygons and Circles may be the apt choice.

Polygons¶
Polygons are a way of showing a territory. In cases where you want to showcase data over an area, polygons are your best pick. You can use them to show Geozones as well.

It’s very like generating a polyline, the basic steps remain the same, create a Data set, generate a polygon and add it to the map.

Mappls Live Demo | Code Pen Implementation

Circles are a method for designating an area on a map with minimal user interaction. A circle is characterized by just two key attributes:

The central point of the circle, specified by its latitude and longitude coordinates.
The radius of the circle.
With these two values, you can effortlessly outline a specific region of interest on a map.

Introduction¶
A simple plugin / widget to pick places from the map. This SDK also has integrated Place Picker Plugin as optional component that enables one to narrow down to picked place by searching for it first and then changing the position of the resulting point on map to fine-tune the results.

The plugin can be used in combination with our Interactive Map JS library but it also possesses the adaptability to be used as an independent plugin within any web app implementation. Thus it enables developers to include Mappls Places JS in their own customized solutions easily.

The SDK offers the following basic functionalities: 1. Ability to pick or search places directly with or without Mappls Maps visual interface. 2. A mappls.placePicker() method to initiate the plugin and pick places from Mappls Maps. 3. Ability to get information from Mappls Place Picker plugin through a callback. 4. Include the Place Picker Plugin with or without an interactive Map component.

                        console.log(data);
                        data1 = data;
});


            
            
        
// Or Without tracking option as a variable
mappls.tracking({
    map: map,
    start: {
        geoposition: "28.63124010064198,77.46734619140625"
    },
    end: {
        geoposition: "28.631541442089226,77.37808227539064"
    },
    fitBounds: true,
    ccpIconWidth: 70,
    strokeWidth: 7,
    routeColor: "blue",
    /*
     cPopup:'<h3>Current Popup</h3>',
     */
}
tracking_plugin = mappls.tracking(tracking_option, function(data) {
    console.log(data);
    trackingCallbackData = data;
});
}
, function(data) {
    console.log(data);
    trackingCallbackData = data;
});

            
            
        
Tracking callbacks¶
trackingCallbackData.settrackfit(true/false); (default is true, fitbounds the track)
trackingCallbackData.setccpContent(“content”); (set popup on start)
DEPRECATED: trackingCallbackData.setLineHide(true/false); (to make path invisible)
trackingCallbackData.removeCurveLine(); // to remove curved polylines.
trackingCallbackData.setLineVisible(true); // to show/hide polyline on map.
trackingCallbackData.setCcpVisible(true); // to show/hide ccp Icon(default is true).
trackingCallbackData.getEta(function(data){console.log(data);}) //to fetch eta & distance from the plugin
Recommendation: When you wish to switch between curved line and route line between source & destination¶
Before rider picks up:¶
Show the Curved line.
curveLine:true
Hide the Route line.
strokeOpacity:0 and if connector:true, set connectorVisible:false
After rider picks up:¶
Call trackingCallBackData.removeCurveLine(); to remove the curved line.
Call trackingCallBackData.setLineVisible(true); to set the route line to visible.
Methods¶
mappls.tracking()

Step 6: Method to inject User data¶
     trackingCallbackData.trackingCall({
       location: user, // Required
       reRoute: true, // default true or optional
       heading: true, // default true
       mapCenter: false, // default false
       polylineRefresh: true /* it refreshes the covered route */,
       buffer: 50, // default 25
       etaRefresh: true /* to get distance and duration in callback */,
       latentViz: false /* when clicked on map, icon first goes to clicked path with following route  */,
       delay: 3000, // default 5000
       fitCoverDistance:true, // default is false 
       fitBounds: true, // default true
       smoothFitBounds: false, //default: false; other values: "slow"||"med"||"fast"
       fitboundsOptions: {
         padding: 80,
       },
       callback: function (datap) {
         console.log(datap);
       },
     });

            
            
        
IMPORTANT NOTE: This method should NOT be called in any scenario of less than 3 seconds. For best results, call this method at-least once every 15 seconds. For long duration tracking, it is recommended to call this method more frequently than the period between gethering rider locations - polling frequency of your tracking; keeping above restrictions in mind.

Properties¶
Mandatory Parameters¶
location (array): Coordinate array as [longitude,latitude]
Optional Parameters¶
reRoute (boolean): To refresh the route as per the current location. This means the route will change as per the current location. If kept false the same route will be displayed. Default is true.
heading (boolean): To control the rotation of the marker as per the route direction.For example if you are using a car icon, it would rotate as per the route direction otherwise it would move straight. Default is true.
buffer (integer):50, The distance defined for call reroute for the provided current location.
fitBounds (boolean): Allowing this would fit the map in the view bound. Default is true.
mapCenter (boolean):true, keeps the current on the center of the map.
fitBoundsOptions: add padding to the fitBounds, if fitBounds is set as true.
    fitBoundsOptions: 
    {
        padding:80
    }, // optional

            
            
        
fitCoverDistance (boolean): includes the last movement within the fitBounds call. //default is true
polylineRefresh (boolean): removes the covered route as the rider progresses. // default true
latentViz (boolean): Smooth visualization when rider suddenly jumps off-route. Incurs an additional routing call.// default false
etaRefresh (boolean): updates the ETA if the route followed has not changed periodically to reflect the ever changing live traffic.// default false
delay (integer): miliseconds indicating within how much time each subsequent location movement animation is to be completed. Default is 3000 ms.
smoothFitBounds (boolean or string): To enable/disable ultra-smooth fitbound automation that the widget performs with each animation - even with interpolated data. // default false with options to set it to "slow" OR "med" OR "fast"; wherein:
slow - fitbound action every 1 interpolated location.
med - fitbound action every 3 interpolated location.
fast - fitbound action every 5 interpolated location.
Multi Stop Routing¶
This Multi Stop Routing allows users to define and manage via points. Via points represent important locations along a route, such as waypoints, checkpoints, or stops. Each via point is assigned a unique ID, a geographical position (latitude & longitude), and a custom marker icon for easy identification on the map.
